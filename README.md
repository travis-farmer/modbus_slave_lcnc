# modbus_slave_lcnc_changer

this Arduino project uses this library: https://github.com/travis-farmer/ModbusRTUSlave which i have mirrored from https://github.com/CMB27/ModbusRTUSlave just in case the original creator makes a change that breaks my config.

so far this project is just in the EXPLORITIVE TEST phase, meaning nothing changes tools yet...
